                    </header>

                    <p>I've spent over a decade working at the intersection of technology, documentation, and
                        engineering systems, usually in places where scale exposes every small decision.</p>

                    <p>I began my career in fast-moving e-commerce teams, where shipping was urgent and documentation
                        was optional until it wasn't. Since then, I've worked closely with platform and engineering
                        teams on documentation architecture, tooling, and large-scale migrations, often inheriting
                        systems that grew faster than anyone planned.</p>

                    <p>Along the way, I've built internal tools and automation that saved significant time and
                        operational cost for the teams I worked with. Most of that work sits behind NDAs, living quietly
                        inside companies as scripts, pipelines, and processes that "just work". They don't have public
                        case studies. They do have fewer manual hours, fewer errors, and fewer late-night escalations.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>If you want proof, the best place to look isn't this blog, it's the people I've worked
                            with.</strong></p>

                    <p>My strength lies in seeing patterns early: where content systems break, where processes won't
                        scale, and where a small technical fix can prevent a large organisational problem later. I'm
                        comfortable working in ambiguity, translating between engineers and non-engineers, and building
                        solutions that survive long after the excitement of launch wears off.</p>

                    <p>This blog is where I write about those experiences, without breaching NDAs, focusing on systems,
                        incentives, and the unglamorous work that keeps technology running.</p>
