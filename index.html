							<h3>Before This Year Ends, There Is One Conversation We Keep Avoiding</h3>
							<p>This is my last article of the year. Not a recap. Not a prediction. Not a lesson learned
								post. This is the one thing I believe deserves the highest priority before we move on
								and pretend everything is fine.</p>

							<h3>I Tried to Keep Up With AI This Year</h3>

							<h3>The Curious Case of the "Reliable" Employee</h3>
							<p>Every organization has that one invisible superpower. Not leadership. Not innovation. Not
								strategy. Reliability. Once you demonstrate it, something fascinating happens.</p>

							<h3>The Quiet Weight We Carry When the Market Slows Down</h3>
							<p>There is something nobody tells you when you start your career. You think that working
								hard and learning every day will bring clarity. You assume that skill will protect you.
