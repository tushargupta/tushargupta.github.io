                    <p><em>Published on 20 November 2025 | Category: Technology</em></p>

                    <p>I did something very brave last night.</p>

                    <p>I tried watching the new AI-generated Mahabharat: Ek Dharmayudh on JioHotstar, produced by
                        Collective Media Network (a division of Collective Artists Network).</p>

                    <p>And I survived… for about 20 minutes.</p>

                    <p>After that, my neurons filed an HR complaint.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <p>You see, this wasn't just inspired by AI.<br />
                        This was AI. No actors. No expressions. Just fake and slow motion algorithmic enlightenment.</p>

                    <p>Every character looked like they were halfway through buffering. Brahma had all the charisma of a
                        frozen Teams call and Ganga's expressions were so still that even a stone idol might've looked
                        more emotionally available.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <p>Now, I get it.<br />
                        Technology is amazing.<br />
                        AI can write poems, paint portraits, even flirt (badly) in your DMs.</p>

                    <p>But there's a difference between "Can we do it?" and "Should we?" and somewhere in a meeting
                        room, someone clearly said:</p>

                    <blockquote>"Guys, what if we remake Mahabharat, but… fire the humans?"</blockquote>

                    <p>The result?<br />
                        A digital dharmayudh where pixels fight pixels, and no one wins.</p>

                    <p>Watching it felt like someone tried to feed ChatGPT the entire Bhagavad Gita and it responded
                        with:</p>

                    <blockquote>"Generating… inner peace.exe"</blockquote>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <p>Here's the irony: Mahabharat was about emotion, ego, dharma, and humanity.<br />
                        This one had none of that.</p>

                    <p>It's like trying to recreate "Sholay" using Excel formulas.</p>

                    <p>Technically possible (It is). Spiritually criminal.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <p>AI is brilliant when it assists creativity. But when it tries to replace creativity, it just
                        exposes how little it understands why humans create in the first place.</p>

                    <p>You can train a model to generate Arjun's face, but you can't train it to feel his doubt.</p>

                    <p>So here's my humble request to all future AI-enthusiast producers out there:</p>

                    <p><strong>PLEASE. Step away from the epics.</strong></p>

                    <p><em>[Edit: Collective Media Network's next disaster is Chiranjeevi Hanuman – The Eternal.]</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>Let's start with something easier, like Sasural Simar Ka: The Neural Network Edition.</p>

                    <p>Because if Mahabharat has taught us anything, it's that even the gods couldn't automate dharma.
                    </p>
