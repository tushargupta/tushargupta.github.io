									<p>Most documentation teams underestimate what DITA really enables. They treat DITA as a formatting tool, not an architecture. But the real power of DITA lies not in XML tags - it lies in semantic precision, modular thinking, and reader intent alignment.</p>

									<h2>The Common Misconception</h2>
									<p>I've seen too many teams treat DITA topics like templates with labels:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Concept = theory</li>
										<li>Task = steps</li>
										<li>Reference = data</li>
									</ul>
									<p>That's an oversimplification. And in high-performing teams, it's also a red flag.</p>

									<h2>A Better Approach to DITA Topic Design</h2>
									<p>Here's how I would approach DITA topic design in practice:</p>

									<h3>🔸 Concept Topics: Mental Models, Not Introductions</h3>
									<p>Concept topics are not "introductions." They are mental models. They should orient, connect, and frame the "why" behind the "what." A well-crafted concept topic teaches more than it tells. It anticipates confusion, and dissolves it through clarity and relevance.</p>
									
									<blockquote>Example: Instead of saying "This is an API token," say "This token authenticates users without exposing credentials, think of it like a digital valet key."</blockquote>

									<h3>🔸 Task Topics: User Journeys with Context</h3>
									<p>Task topics are not checklists. They are user journeys with context. A proper task topic defines where the user is coming from, what they need, and what success looks like. It includes conditional paths, embedded troubleshooting cues, and post-action validation.</p>
									
									<blockquote>Example: For a task like "Configure your firewall," don't just list steps. Define preconditions, alert the user to what could go wrong, and show what a successful outcome looks like.</blockquote>

									<h3>🔸 Reference Topics: Decision Accelerators</h3>
									<p>Reference topics are not repositories. They are decision accelerators. The goal is instant retrieval, not passive reading. Use structure that lets readers skim with precision: tables, parameters, flags, syntax, examples, and always cross-reference for discoverability.</p>

									<h2>The Key Insight</h2>
									<p>👉 The difference between filling in tags and designing information systems is huge.</p>
									<p>DITA is only as powerful as your ability to model thought, not just content.</p>
