                    <p><em>Published on 27 November 2025 | Category: Technology</em></p>

                    <p>For years, I tried using few so called "perfect" productivity or PKM (Personal Knowledge
                        Management) setup out there: Notion, Obsidian, Roam, Evernote, you name it. Each time, I ended
                        up where many folks do: over-engineering the system instead of actually using it.</p>

                    <p>Few months ago, I came across a workflow that felt simple. I adapted it, improved it, and it has
                        fundamentally changed how I capture, organize, and retrieve information.</p>

                    <p>And the best part? It works beautifully even with a busy schedule, long work hours, and constant
                        context switching.</p>

                    <h2>The Breakthrough: Moving from Complexity to Clarity</h2>
                    <p>The original idea came from a Reddit post where the author talked about failing to maintain
                        complex systems. That hit home.</p>

                    <p>As someone who builds automation, writes technical content, and juggles multiple workflows, I
                        always believed more structure equals more efficiency. Turns out, it's the opposite.</p>

                    <p>So, instead of referencing the Western productivity gurus, let me use something closer home (sort
                        of):</p>

                    <p>In "The 5 AM Club" by Robin Sharma, there's a recurring message:</p>

                    <blockquote>"Small, consistent changes are more powerful than dramatic overhauls."</blockquote>
                    <p>That's exactly what this workflow embodies.</p>

                    <h2>My "Google Brain" Workflow (2025 Edition)</h2>
                    <p>A simple 3-layer system that uses everyday tools + AI to create a powerful second brain.</p>

                    <h3>1. Capture (Quick): Google Keep</h3>
                    <p>Whenever a thought strikes, an idea, a technical insight, something I want to learn, or even a
                        random note, I dump it into Google Keep.</p>

                    <p>No tags. No folders. No fancy templates. Just pure, friction less capture.</p>

                    <h3>2. Storage (Organizer-Lite): Google Docs</h3>
                    <p>Every week, I clean up my Keep notes and paste them into a single monthly document:</p>

                    <p>"Tech Logbook – October 2025"<br />
                        "Ideas and Learning – November 2025", etc.</p>

                    <p>This becomes my digital diary of everything I learned, explored, solved, or built.</p>

                    <p>Occasionally I format with bullet points, but nothing more.</p>

                    <h3>3. Retrieval (AI-Powered): NotebookLM</h3>
                    <p>This is the real game changer.</p>

                    <p>I upload my monthly Google Doc into NotebookLM, and it becomes the "AI memory layer" that can
                        answer questions like:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"Summaries all key learning from last month."</li>
                        <li>"Show me every idea I noted related to automation."</li>
                        <li>"What were the major problems I explored recently?"</li>
                        <li>"What tasks did I note for self-improvement or future projects?"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>No manual organization. No searching for old files. Just conversational recall.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Works For Me (and Probably Will For Many)</h2>

                    <h3>1. Low friction → High consistency</h3>
                    <p>Complex tools cause fatigue. This system removes the cognitive load.</p>

                    <h3>2. Manual review → Better clarity</h3>
                    <p>I deliberately did not automate transferring Keep → Docs. Typing or moving things manually forces
                        me to think and refine.</p>

                    <h3>3. AI replaces "heavy structure"</h3>
                    <p>Instead of rigid folders, tags, and templates, NotebookLM handles the retrieval layer.</p>

                    <h3>4. Sustainable long-term</h3>
                    <p>With long working hours, meetings, sprints, and deadlines, I needed something lightweight and
                        "maintenance-free".</p>

                    <h2>How This Helps Me in My Career</h2>
                    <p>As someone who works across:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Technical automation</li>
                        <li>Documentation and content engineering</li>
                        <li>Process optimization</li>
                        <li>Learning and exploring new tools and technologies</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>…this workflow helps me retain clarity, reduce stress, and stay future-ready.</p>

                    <p>It also keeps me experimenting with emerging tools, something I believe is essential for staying
                        relevant in the modern tech ecosystem.</p>

                    <h2>The Bigger Idea</h2>
                    <p>In a world obsessed with complex productivity systems, sometimes the most powerful solution is
                        the simplest one. Not everyone needs (or can afford) a full-fledged "second brain" built on
                        Notion or Obsidian.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes, Google Keep + Google Docs + an AI layer is more than enough.</p>
