                    <p><em>Published on December 27, 2025 | Category: Technology</em></p>

                    <p>At the start of this year, AI felt like that overachieving colleague who replies to emails in
                        thirty seconds and still has time for yoga. By March, it felt like that colleague had cloned
                        themselves and taken over half the building.</p>

                    <p>Every week there was a new model, a new tool, a new demo that promised to change everything
                        forever. Again. I stopped saying things like I will learn this over the weekend because my
                        weekends were already booked by new releases before Friday evening.</p>

                    <p>At some point I realized something important. AI was not moving fast to replace people. It was
                        moving fast to expose how differently people work.</p>

                    <p>Some folks used it to copy paste their way through the day and hoped nobody noticed. Others used
                        it like a power tool. Still human. Still thinking. Just faster and slightly more smug about it.
                    </p>

                    <p>I also learned that prompts are the new soft skill. Not the poetic kind. The awkward very
                        specific kind. The difference between getting something useful and getting absolute nonsense
                        often came down to whether you knew what you were actually asking for. Turns out clarity is
                        still a rare and valuable skill. Who knew.</p>

                    <p>Another surprise was how often AI failed in very confident ways. It answered questions I did not
                        ask. It explained things that were already obvious. It occasionally invented facts with the
                        enthusiasm of a college student writing an essay at two in the morning. Which was oddly
                        comforting. At least one of us was still winging it.</p>

                    <p>The biggest shift though was not technical. It was mental.</p>

                    <p>People who treated AI like magic mostly stayed confused. People who treated it like a junior
                        teammate got real value out of it. You explain. You review. You correct. You do not blindly
                        trust it. Basically the same rules we have used forever, just applied to a machine that never
                        sleeps and never admits it is wrong.</p>

                    <p>By the end of the year, I stopped asking whether AI would take jobs. The better question was who
                        is willing to learn, adapt, and stay curious without panicking every time the internet declares
                        a revolution.</p>

                    <p>AI did not make work disappear. It made thinking more visible. And sometimes that visibility is
                        uncomfortable.</p>

                    <p>So if this year felt overwhelming, you are not behind. You are just living through a very loud
                        learning curve. Keep building. Keep questioning. And if the tool confidently tells you something
                        that feels wrong, trust your instincts. They are still very much in demand.</p>

                    <p>And yes, my coffee machine is still dumb. Which honestly feels reassuring at this point.</p>
