                    <p>Every organization has that one invisible superpower.</p>

                    <p>Not leadership.<br />
                        Not innovation.<br />
                        Not strategy.</p>

                    <p>Reliability.</p>

                    <p>Once you demonstrate it, something fascinating happens.</p>

                    <p>You deliver on time.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>So you get more work.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You stretch a little.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>So the stretch becomes the norm.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You save a slipping project.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>So now you own it, along with its history, baggage, and unresolved mistakes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Meanwhile, others continue to work… comfortably.</p>

                    <p>Five or Six hours a day.<br />
                        Predictable output.<br />
                        Zero urgency.<br />
                        Zero consequences.</p>

                    <p>And somehow, the system decides:<br />
                        "Let's not disturb them."</p>

                    <p>Instead, the work keeps flowing, towards the same person. The one who "can handle it."</p>

                    <p>Projects are reassigned.<br />
                        Timelines get shorter.<br />
                        Context gets thinner.<br />
                        And accountability? That's transferable.</p>

                    <p>Someone else's miss becomes your escalation.<br />
                        Someone else's delay becomes your emergency.<br />
                        Someone else's poor planning becomes your late nights.</p>

                    <p>All wrapped neatly under phrases like:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"You're dependable"</li>
                        <li>"You've done this before"</li>
                        <li>"We trust you"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Trust, it seems, is measured in how much more weight you can carry before breaking.</p>

                    <p>What's rarely discussed is the cost.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The fatigue that doesn't go away after the weekend.</li>
                        <li>The health issues brushed off as "just stress."</li>
                        <li>The quiet resentment of watching effort being punished with… more effort.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>And still, the workload never reduces.<br />
                        It only accumulates.</p>

                    <p>This isn't a rant against hard work.<br />
                        Hard work is honorable.</p>

                    <p>This is about a system where efficiency becomes exploitation, and balance is selectively applied.
                    </p>

                    <p>At some point, organizations must ask themselves a hard question:</p>

                    <p>Are we rewarding performance—<br />
                        or simply offloading responsibility onto the people least likely to say no?</p>

                    <p>Because reliability, when taken for granted, stops being a strength.</p>

                    <p>It becomes a liability, worn by the very people keeping things afloat.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <p>If you're reading this and nodding along, pause for a second.</p>

                    <p>The fact that you care this much, deliver this consistently, and still show up - even when it's
                        unfair - speaks volumes.</p>

                    <p>You are doing more than your share.<br />
                        You are doing it with integrity.</p>

                    <p>And yes - if you are that person, you are awesome. Never let a broken workload convince you
                        otherwise.</p>
