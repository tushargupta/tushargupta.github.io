                    <p><em>Published on 17 November 2025 | Category: Technology</em></p>

                    <p>Few weeks ago, I asked AI to write a thank you note for a friend's birthday, because apparently,
                        even gratitude needs automation now.</p>

                    <p>That's when it hit me, I've officially become the unpaid intern of my own AI tools.</p>

                    <p>I used to think for a living. Now I just prompt. I used to write articles. Now I just edit what
                        AI wrote and call it "collaboration."</p>

                    <p>Other day, I opened a new AI chat and dictated something deep like, "Write a thought provoking
                        paragraph about creativity and human intellect." And boom, it gives me a 400 word essay that
                        sounds like an over-caffeinated philosopher who just discovered Grammarly.</p>

                    <p>But here's the problem: The more it writes, the more I forget how to. It's like having a gym
                        membership but only sending my trainer to work out.</p>

                    <p>At first, it was my curiosity.<br />
                        "AI will just help me summarize emails."</p>

                    <p>Now it's like,<br />
                        "AI, can you summarize my purpose in life and create a PowerPoint?"</p>

                    <p>I've realized something very uneasy (and I guess so have most people): the less I think, the more
                        I scroll. The less I create, the more I copy. And the more I rely on AI, the more my brain
                        quietly updates its LinkedIn headline to 'Open to opportunities (preferably offline)'.</p>

                    <p>So here's what I'm doing now:</p>

                    <p>I'm forcing myself to write one paragraph a day without using AI. It's chaotic. It's messy. But
                        atleast it's mine.</p>

                    <p>I'm trying to remember phone numbers. (Haven't succeeded, but I did memorize the OTP.)</p>

                    <p>And I'm learning to live with typos, because at least I made them.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <p>I'm not anti-AI.<br />
                        It's incredible. It saves time, polishes ideas, and occasionally makes me sound smarter than I
                        am. But I don't want to wake up one day and realize that the only original thought I have left
                        is "AI, can you make this sound more human?"</p>

                    <p>So yes, use AI. But don't let it use you.<br />
                        Let it be your assistant, not your author.<br />
                        Let it edit your words, not erase your mind.</p>

                    <p>And most importantly, write something today that's messy, raw, and wrong in all the right ways.
                    </p>

                    <p>Because that's the one thing AI still can't do, be gloriously, unapologetically human.</p>
